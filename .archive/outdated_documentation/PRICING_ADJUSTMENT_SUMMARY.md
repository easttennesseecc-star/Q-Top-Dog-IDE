## 💡 RATIONALE

### Problem: Digital Ocean Costs
- **Issue**: Infrastructure costs ~$5/user/month
- **Old Pro**: $12/mo - $5 = $7/mo margin (only 58%)
- **Old Teams**: $25/mo - $5 = $20/mo margin (only 76%, too thin)
- **Result**: Can't scale profitably, especially with support costs

### Solution: Tiered Pricing with Better Margins
```
Pro:           $15/mo revenue - $5 infrastructure = $10/mo margin (67%) ✅
Teams Starter: $30/mo revenue - $7 infrastructure = $23/mo margin (77%) ✅
Teams Pro:     $40/mo revenue - $8 infrastructure = $32/mo margin (80%) ✅
Teams Ent:     $50/mo revenue - $9 infrastructure = $41/mo margin (82%) ✅
```

### Why These Prices Work
- **Pro $15**: Only 25% increase (not aggressive), still $1.25/day
- **Teams $30-50**: Reflects value of team features, each tier adds value
- **Margins**: All tiers 67-82% (sustainable and scalable)
- **Competitive**: Still cheaper than GitHub, Figma, VS Code Pro

## ❓ ENTERPRISE PRICING - NEEDS YOUR DECISION

### Question: What should custom enterprise pricing be?

**Options**:
1. **Conservative**: $100-200/seat
   - Pro: Lower barrier to entry
   - Con: May leave money on table

2. **Aggressive**: $300-500/seat
   - Pro: Maximize value capture
   - Con: Might lose some deals

3. **Flexible**: Start at $150, negotiate based on:
   - Deployment (self-hosted vs cloud)
   - Compliance (HIPAA, FedRAMP, etc.)
   - Customization (custom features)
   - Support level
   - Multi-year commitment

4. **Sales-driven**: Let sales team propose custom pricing
   - Pro: Sales has deal context
   - Con: Inconsistent pricing

### Additional Considerations
- **Minimum commit**: $5K, $10K, $25K/month?
- **Setup fee**: $10K, $50K?
- **Custom features**: Extra $5K-50K each?
- **Discounts**: Volume discounts at what thresholds?
- **Contracting**: 1-year, 3-year, multi-year options?

**Recommendation**: Schedule 30-min call with sales/finance to finalize Enterprise tier
