## KEY PRINCIPLES

### Build It Right, Not Fast
```
Slow and steady is better than quick and broken.
Quality code = fewer bugs = faster debugging = faster overall.
```

### Ship Incrementally
```
Week 1: Core working (even if not perfect)
Week 2: All features working
Week 3: Polish and optimize
Week 4: Launch beta
```

### Test Everything
```
Unit tests: Test individual functions
E2E tests: Test full user flows
Manual testing: Catch edge cases
Before launch: No critical bugs
```

### Communicate Daily
```
Daily standup: 3:30 PM (15 min)
Share blockers immediately
Help each other
Update progress
```

---

## IF YOU GET STUCK

**"Where do I start?"**
→ Read QUICK_START first (30 min), then IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST

**"What's the first task?"**
→ Task 1.1: Build AI Marketplace Registry (320 lines, 2 days)

**"How long will this take?"**
→ 10 working days (Nov 10-20) if you follow the plan

**"What if we hit blockers?"**
→ All answers are in the SPEC. Read that section.

**"Can we change the plan?"**
→ Sure, but complete the 10 days first. Then iterate.

**"What if a provider API goes down?"**
→ Routing logic includes fallbacks. Use alternative provider.

**"How do we handle security?"**
→ All covered in SPEC section on security + authentication

---

## WHAT HAPPENS AFTER (Week 4+)

### Private Beta (Nov 20-27)
```
├─ 100 beta users invited
├─ Monitor metrics
├─ Gather feedback
├─ Fix bugs
└─ Prepare for public launch
```

### Integration Phase (Nov 28-Dec 5)
```
├─ Connect marketplace to IntelliSense
├─ Connect marketplace to Debugger
├─ Connect marketplace to Refactoring
├─ Connect marketplace to Game Engines
└─ ~4 hours total work per integration
```

### Scale (Dec 6+)
```
├─ Add more models (100+)
├─ Expand to more users (10k+)
├─ Monitor revenue (should be $50k+ MRR)
├─ Plan enterprise features
└─ Prepare for public launch (Jan 2026)
```

---

## COMPETITIVE POSITION

**Before Marketplace**:
```
Top Dog vs VS Code:
├─ VS Code: #1 IDE (IntelliSense, Debugging, Refactoring)
├─ Top Dog: #2 IDE (same features + Game engines)
└─ Result: VS Code still wins on IDE features
```

**After Marketplace**:
```
Top Dog vs VS Code:
├─ VS Code: Best IDE
├─ Top Dog: Best IDE + ONLY IDE with 50+ AI models
├─ Result: Top Dog has unique selling point
└─ Winner: Top Dog (for developers who want AI)
```

**Bottom Line**: Marketplace makes Top Dog UNIQUE. VS Code can't easily copy this (would break their business model).
