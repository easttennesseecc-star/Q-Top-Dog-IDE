# 🔐 Top Dog API Key Responsibility Model

**TL;DR**: You bring your own API keys. Top Dog doesn't provide them, store them insecurely, or charge you for LLM usage. You pay the provider directly.

---

## Three Core Rules

### Rule 1: Free Tier = Free/Local Models Only ✅
```
Free users get:
✅ Ollama (local Llama, Mistral, etc.) - 100% free
✅ LLaMA models - Open source, no keys needed
✅ GPT4All - Local, private, completely free
✅ No API keys required
✅ Works completely offline
```

### Rule 2: Pro/Teams/Enterprise = BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) 🔑
```
Paid users can add their own keys:
✅ OpenAI GPT-4 (you pay OpenAI directly)
✅ Google Gemini (you pay Google directly)
✅ Anthropic Claude (you pay Anthropic directly)
✅ Still can use free local models too
✅ You manage all keys in Top Dog Settings
```

### Rule 3: Top Dog Never Handles Your API Keys ⛔
```
What Top Dog does NOT do:
❌ Store your keys on our servers
❌ Charge you for API usage
❌ Log or monitor your API calls
❌ Share keys with anyone
❌ Process payments for LLM usage
```

### 👥 TEAMS TIER ($25/seat/month)

## Security & Privacy: How We Protect Your Keys

### Key Storage (Encrypted)
```
Your API Key
     ↓
Encrypted using system keyring
     ↓
Stored in: ~/.Top Dog/llm_keys.json
     ↓
Only readable by your user on your machine
```

### Key Usage (Private)
```
Your encrypted key
     ↓
Top Dog decrypts only when you use AI feature
     ↓
Key sent directly to provider (OpenAI, Google, etc.)
     ↓
Top Dog NEVER logs, stores, or monitors the request
     ↓
Response returned to Top Dog
     ↓
Top Dog displays to you, then forgets
```

## Common Questions

### Q: What if Top Dog gets hacked?
**A:** Hackers can't access your API keys because:
- Keys stored in system keyring (encrypted)
- Keys never sent to Top Dog servers
- Top Dog doesn't know your keys on the backend
- Even if they hacked our servers, they'd find nothing

**Recommendation:** Rotate your API key on OpenAI's dashboard annually for safety.

---

### Q: Will my Top Dog bill include LLM costs?
**A:** No. Ever.
- Top Dog invoice: Top Dog features only ($0-$25/month)
- OpenAI invoice: Separate, direct from OpenAI
- No hidden LLM fees in your Top Dog bill

---

### Q: Can I use multiple LLM providers?
**A:** Yes! Assign different providers to different tasks:
```
Settings → LLM Configuration:
├─ Coding role: OpenAI GPT-4 ($)
├─ Documentation role: Google Gemini (free)
├─ Research role: Local Ollama ($0)
└─ Top Dog picks the best one automatically
```

---

### Q: What if OpenAI's API goes down?
**A:** Top Dog keeps working:
- GPT-4 feature becomes unavailable
- You can still use local Ollama
- Your code doesn't disappear
- Service resumes when OpenAI recovers

---

### Q: Can I use Top Dog without any API keys?
**A:** Yes! Use the free local models:
```
Free tier: Always works with Ollama
Pro/Teams/Enterprise: Use Pro tier WITHOUT adding any keys
└─ You'd just use local models
└─ No extra features, but completely free LLM usage
```

---

### Q: What if I lose my API key?
**A:** 
1. Go to OpenAI/Google/Anthropic dashboard
2. Delete the old key
3. Generate a new one
4. Update it in Top Dog Settings
5. Done (takes 2 minutes)

---

### Q: Can I share my API key with coworkers?
**A:** 

❌ **NOT recommended** (security risk):
- Anyone with the key can use it
- Anyone can accidentally consume your budget
- Not accountable if something goes wrong

✅ **Better approach** (Teams tier):
- Set up a shared key with spending limits
- Or give each person their own key
- Manager tracks usage on provider dashboard

---

### Q: How do I set a spending limit?
**A:** On the provider's side (not Top Dog):

**OpenAI:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits
2. Set "Hard limit" (max spend per month)
3. Set "Soft limit" (alert threshold)

**Google Gemini:**
1. Go to Google Cloud Console
2. Set quotas for APIs
3. Monitor usage
