# Billing Terms (BYOK Directory Mode)

Effective: 2025‑11‑02

## 1. Model
We charge flat subscription fees for Q‑IDE features. You bring your own model API keys (BYOK) and pay model providers directly. We do not re‑sell tokens or charge per‑token fees.

## 2. Plans & Seats
- Plans: Free, Pro, Teams (S/P), Enterprise (custom)
- Seats: Billed per active seat. You can add/remove seats anytime. Mid‑cycle changes are prorated.
- Enterprise: Contract terms may supersede some policies below.

## 3. Billing Cycle & Payment
- Billing cycle: Monthly by default; annual available on request.
- Payment methods: Credit card (self‑serve) or invoice (enterprise).
- Taxes/VAT: Applied where required by law.

## 4. Renewals & Cancellation
- Subscriptions auto‑renew at the end of each term.
- You can cancel at any time; your subscription remains active until the end of the current term.
- No early termination fees. Access continues through term end.

## 5. Refunds & Credits
- Mid‑cycle downgrades or seat removals are credited pro‑rata to your account balance.
- Refunds to original payment method may be granted at our discretion in exceptional cases.

## 6. Add‑ons
- Regulated Segments (Medical/Scientific): Sold as subscription add‑ons; no per‑token markup.
- Verified provenance & audit storage: Billed as a storage quota or tier; overages throttle or require upgrade.

## 7. Fair Use & Abuse
- Demo models are strictly non‑production with rate limits/quotas.
- We reserve the right to limit abusive usage that disrupts service quality.

## 8. Data & Security
- You own your provider accounts/keys. Keys are stored encrypted and used only to call providers you configure.
- Logs/telemetry may include non‑sensitive metadata for support and reliability.
