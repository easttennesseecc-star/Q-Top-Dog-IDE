# Brand Canonical: Top Dog by Quellum

This repository follows the canonical branding and product segmentation below.

- Company: Quellum
- Product Brand: Top Dog (autonomous IDE)
- Divisions (editions):
  - Aura Developer
  - Aura Medical
  - Aura Scientific

Usage rules
- Primary name in public: "Top Dog". When attribution is needed, use: "Top Dog by Quellum".
- Avoid legacy names: "Q-IDE", "Quellum TopDog IDE" in public-facing docs.
- Divisions appear as badges or qualifiers, e.g., "Top Dog — Aura Medical" for regulated flows.
- Do not modify code fences or filenames during branding changes.

Scope of updates
- Public docs (README, website copy, pricing) must reflect the canonical names above.
- Internal/archival docs may retain legacy names but should be excluded from sweeps.

Notes
- Regulated editions (Aura Medical, Aura Scientific) enforce extra guardrails and verification (Overwatch) per compliance middleware and policy.
