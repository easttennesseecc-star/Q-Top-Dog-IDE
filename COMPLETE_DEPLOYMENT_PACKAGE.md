## TOTAL COST ANALYSIS

### One-Time Costs:
```
Top Dog.com           $15     (1 year)
Top Dog.net           $10     (1 year)
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL ONE-TIME:     $25
```

### Monthly Recurring:
```
DigitalOcean        $12     (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
SSL Cert            $0      (Let's Encrypt FREE)
PostgreSQL          $0      (Included)
Nginx               $0      (Included)
─────────────────────────────
TOTAL MONTHLY:      $12
TOTAL YEARLY:       $144
```

### Annual Summary:
```
First Year:   $169  ($25 one-time + $144)
Next Years:   $154  ($10 renewal + $144)
```

### Revenue Breakeven:
```
Conservative scenario (10 users):
- Average tier: PRO @ $20/month
- 10 users × $20 = $200/month revenue
- Server cost: $12/month
- NET PROFIT: $188/month

This breaks even FASTER THAN COST!

A: Check logs: `tail -f /var/www/Top Dog/backend/logs/error.log`

**Q: Payment processing failed?**
A: Check Stripe Dashboard for webhook errors at https://dashboard.stripe.com
