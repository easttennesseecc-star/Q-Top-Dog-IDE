## Documentation Created

### Production-Ready Guides
1. **DEPLOYMENT_LIVE_AND_OPERATIONAL.md** - Current status summary
2. **DNS_CONFIGURATION_PRODUCTION.md** - DNS setup for production
3. **TLS_CERTIFICATE_SETUP.md** - HTTPS/SSL with Let's Encrypt
4. **MONITORING_SETUP.md** - Prometheus & Grafana monitoring
5. **POSTGRES_BACKUP_SETUP.md** - Automated database backups

### Kubernetes Configuration Files
- `k8s/00-nginx-rbac-fix.yaml` - Fixed ingress controller permissions
- All existing deployment manifests validated and working

### Implementation Scripts
- `UPDATE_HOSTS.ps1` - PowerShell hosts file updater
- `UPDATE_HOSTS_INGRESS.bat` - Batch file for ingress IP config

## Issues Resolved This Session

### Issue 1: "This site can't be reached - ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT"
**Root Cause**: Ingress controller had no RBAC permissions  
**Symptoms**: Couldn't list services/endpointslices, ingress had no ADDRESS  
**Solution**: Applied RBAC fixes, added missing permissions  
**Result**: Ingress now has address `129.212.190.208`

### Issue 2: Domain names not working
**Root Cause**: Hosts file didn't map to correct ingress IP  
**Solution**: Updated to use ingress address instead of LoadBalancer  
**Result**: All domains now accessible

### Issue 3: Middleware blocking K8s health probes (earlier session)
**Root Cause**: TrustedHostMiddleware rejecting requests from pod IPs  
**Solution**: Modified SelectiveHostMiddleware to allow /health endpoints  
**Result**: All pods reached 1/1 Ready status
