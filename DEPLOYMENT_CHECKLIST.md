## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT (Execute These Steps)

### Step 1: Git Commit & Tag (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Stage all changes
git add .

# 2. Commit
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 0.1.0"

# 3. Create tag
git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release Top Dog v0.1.0 - Production Ready"

# 4. Verify tag
git tag -l v0.1.0

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
git push origin v0.1.0
```

Checklist:
- [ ] Git commit successful
- [ ] Tag created (v0.1.0)
- [ ] Pushed to origin
- [ ] No merge conflicts
- [ ] Main branch is up-to-date

### Step 2: GitHub Actions Builds (10 minutes)

GitHub Actions automatically runs when tag is pushed:

Monitor here: https://github.com/quellum/Top Dog/actions

Checklist:
- [ ] Actions workflow triggered (look for "Build and Release")
- [ ] Windows build status: In Progress → Success
- [ ] macOS build status: In Progress → Success
- [ ] Linux build status: In Progress → Success
- [ ] Release creation: In Progress → Success
- [ ] All artifacts uploaded to GitHub Release

**Expected artifacts:**
- [ ] Windows MSI installer (.msi)
- [ ] Windows portable executable (.exe)
- [ ] macOS DMG (.dmg)
- [ ] macOS APP bundle (.app)
- [ ] Linux AppImage (.AppImage)
- [ ] Linux DEB package (.deb)

### Step 2.5: Kubernetes Registry Auth (Required for DOKS/Helm pulls)

If deploying the backend image from DigitalOcean Container Registry (DOCR), create the image pull secret in the target namespace before or right after Helm install. Replace placeholders with your values.

PowerShell (Windows):

1) Export a DOCR read-only token to an env var for the session

   $Env:DOCR_TOKEN = "<docr-read-token>"

2) Create or update the secret (namespace must match your release)

   kubectl create secret docker-registry docr-secret `
     --docker-server=registry.digitalocean.com `
     --docker-username=doct `
     --docker-password=$Env:DOCR_TOKEN `
     --docker-email=dummy@example.com `
     --namespace=topdog `
     --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -

3) Verify and restart the deployment if needed

   kubectl get secret docr-secret -n topdog
   kubectl rollout restart deploy/topdog -n topdog

Checklist:
- [ ] docr-secret exists in namespace
- [ ] Pods are not in ImagePullBackOff
- [ ] Images pull successfully from DOCR
