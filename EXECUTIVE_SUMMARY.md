## THE 5 DECISION CALLS (Make Today)

### Decision #1: Language Server Strategy
**Question**: How do we get fast semantic analysis?  
**Recommendation**: Use LSP (TypeScript, Python existing servers)  
**Why**: 3-5 days vs 2-3 weeks. Production-proven.  
**Decision**: ✅ DO THIS

### Decision #2: Collaboration Sync
**Question**: How do we sync multi-user edits?  
**Recommendation**: Use Yjs (CRDT)  
**Why**: Proven in Figma, Google Docs. Simpler than custom OT.  
**Decision**: ✅ DO THIS (Week 3-4)

### Decision #3: Debugging
**Question**: How do we add debugging?  
**Recommendation**: Use DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol)  
**Why**: Works day 1. Industry standard.  
**Decision**: ✅ DO THIS

### Decision #4: Launch Strategy
**Question**: Public or private beta?  
**Recommendation**: Private beta (100 users) then public  
**Why**: Get feedback safely. Fix bugs before public.  
**Decision**: ✅ DO THIS

### Decision #5: Mobile Timeline
**Question**: When do we do mobile?  
**Recommendation**: Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)  
**Why**: Focus on desktop first. Mobile multiplier effect later.  
**Decision**: ✅ DO THIS
