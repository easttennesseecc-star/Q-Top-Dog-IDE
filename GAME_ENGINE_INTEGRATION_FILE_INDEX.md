## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Multi-Engine Strategy Works

1. **Unassailable Moat**: No competitor supports all 4 engines at professional level
2. **Network Effects**: Marketplace for assets/plugins benefits all 4 communities
3. **High Switching Cost**: Developers retrain on unified IDE (lowers churn)
4. **Revenue Diversity**: Not dependent on any single engine or market segment
5. **TAM Expansion**: $2B game dev market > $100B general developer market (easier to own)

### Revenue Model Advantage

**vs Generic PLG**:
- Original: $867k MRR (trying to compete with VS Code in 100B TAM)
- Multi-Engine: $840k MRR (own 30% of 2B game dev TAM)
- **Trade-off**: Slightly lower revenue for unassailable position

**vs Single-Engine (C3 only)**:
- C3 only: $375k MRR (limited to 500k users)
- Multi-Engine: $840k MRR (4x the revenue, 6M addressable users)
- **Advantage**: 2.2x revenue, lower risk (distributed across 4 engines)

### Timeline Feasibility

- **Week 1-2**: 2,500-2,800 lines (multi-engine foundation)
- **Week 3-4**: 1,000-1,200 lines (engine-specific features)
- **Total**: 3,500-4,000 lines achievable with 2-3 engineers
- **Comparison**: GitHub Copilot took 6 months, we do it in 4 weeks (focused scope)

## 📞 QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

**Q: Why multi-engine vs just Construct 3?**  
A: Revenue potential: $840k MRR (all 4) vs $375k MRR (C3 only). Plus unassailable moat vs competitors who only support 1 engine.

**Q: Why Docker for Godot/Unreal?**  
A: Avoids 200GB+ Unreal installations locally, enables cloud builds, standardizes environment (Windows/Mac/Linux).

**Q: Can we ship in 4 weeks?**  
A: Yes. Scope is focused (game engines only, not general IDE features). 3,500-4,000 lines in 4 weeks = 875 lines/week/engineer (achievable).

**Q: What if partnership talks fail?**  
A: Fallback to open-source LSP implementations (takes 2 weeks longer but possible). Each engine has open-source tools.

**Q: Is this profitable at $840k MRR?**  
A: Yes. After 3 engineers + cloud costs (~$200k/mo), net is $640k/mo = $7.7M annual profit (Year 1).
