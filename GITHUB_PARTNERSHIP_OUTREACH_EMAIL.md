Hi {FirstName},

I lead the team at Top Dog, an IDE that runs GitHub at the center of the workflow. We’re complementary to Copilot: same repos/PRs/Actions, plus multi‑LLM BYOK, local/offline options, and reliability guardrails (build‑plan, contract tests, snapshot/rollback).

Teams using “Copilot + Top Dog” see fewer failed PR cycles, faster merges, and more predictable costs—while staying fully GitHub‑native. We only use official APIs, least‑privilege OAuth, and never scrape or train on customer code.

Could we do a quick 20‑minute intro to explore an unofficial/official partnership path? One‑sheet attached and here: `GITHUB_PARTNERSHIP_ONE_SHEET.md`.

Thanks,

P.S. Happy to spin up complimentary Pro seats for your evaluation team.
