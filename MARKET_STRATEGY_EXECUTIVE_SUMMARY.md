3. **53 LLM model router** - User choice, no vendor lock-in (unique)

### Tier 2: Difficult to Copy (1-2 year lead)
1. **Product quality** - Fast, beautiful, well-documented
2. **Community** - Game devs, indie devs, asset marketplace
3. **Pricing strategy** - Market-competitive now (same as GitHub Copilot), positioned for premium tier by Year 2

### Tier 3: Defensible via Speed
