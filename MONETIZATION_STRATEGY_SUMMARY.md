## 📊 Conversion Strategy

### Free → Pro Conversion Triggers
When free users hit these limits, they see Pro benefits:
- **AI Limit**: "You've analyzed 5 codes today"
- **Collaboration**: "Want to pair program?"
- **Debugging**: "Advanced debugging not available"
- **Message**: "Pro = Unlimited AI, collaboration, debugging"

**Expected**: 2-5% of free users convert to Pro

### Pro → Teams Conversion Triggers
When professionals want to collaborate:
- **Inviting**: Pro user tries to invite team members
- **Collaboration**: Wants real-time code sharing
- **Message**: "Teams = $25/seat = better than 3-4 other tools"

**Expected**: 10-20% of Pro users join Teams

### Teams → Enterprise Conversion
When organizations grow beyond 50-100 developers:
- **Scale**: Need self-hosting for 1000+ users
- **Compliance**: Need SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP
- **Features**: Need custom integrations
- **Message**: "Enterprise = designed for Fortune 500 scale"

**Expected**: 50-100 direct sales closes per year

## 💬 FAQ: Monetization Questions

### "Why not just charge everyone?"
Free tier drives massive adoption. With 5M free users:
- Network effects are powerful
- Brand awareness is huge
- Conversion to paid follows naturally
- Price-sensitive users don't block revenue

### "Won't people just stay on free?"
Some will, and that's okay! They:
- Provide feedback and bug reports
- Recommend to paying colleagues
- Become customers later
- Cost us essentially $0 to serve

### "Why not charge students/open source?"
We do! Through special programs:
- **Free Pro tier** for students (GitHub Student Pack)
- **Free Enterprise** for open source projects
- **Academic discount** (50% off)
- Builds loyalty for future

### "What if people pirate Pro?"
- Some will, accept it
- Focus on serving paying customers well
- Most developers respect pricing (not like music/movies)
- Being open source elsewhere (APIs) removes incentive

### "How do we compete with VSCode (free)?"
- VSCode is free because Microsoft uses it to sell Azure
- We're free + premium features + collaboration
- Different markets (VSCode for basics, Pro for professionals)
- No contradiction, complementary
