## 🔐 LLM Model Access & API Key Model (CRITICAL)

### The BYOK Model: Bring Your Own Key

**Top Dog does NOT provide API keys.** Each user/team is directly responsible for their own LLM credentials.

#### How It Works

```
User brings their own key
        ↓
Top Dog stores it securely in user's local config
        ↓
User's API key is used directly with the LLM provider
        ↓
User is directly billed by the provider (OpenAI, Google, etc.)
        ↓
Top Dog never touches the payment or API costs
```

#### Why This Model?

1. **No backend billing complexity** - We don't handle 1000s of different API keys
2. **User in control** - You control your API spend, rate limits, usage
3. **Direct vendor relationship** - You deal directly with OpenAI/Google/Anthropic
4. **Transparent pricing** - No markup, no hidden fees
5. **Privacy** - We never see your API keys (except encrypted at rest)
6. **Compliance** - Easier security/HIPAA/SOC2 compliance

### Free Tier: Free & Open-Source Models Only

**Users on Free tier get:**
- ✅ **Ollama** (local LLMs like Llama 2, Mistral) - 100% free, on-device
- ✅ **LLaMA models** - Open source, download once

**Free tier API key responsibility:**

- ✅ Add their own Google Gemini key
- ✅ Add their own Anthropic Claude key
- ✅ Add their own Cohere key

**Pro/Teams tier API key responsibility:**

- Each user/team directly pays their provider (separate invoice)
- Top Dog does not store, process, or pass through your keys
- Top Dog stores keys only encrypted in the user's local config directory

#### How to Add Your API Key (Pro/Teams)

```
1. Open Top Dog → Settings → LLM Configuration
2. Click "Add LLM Provider"
3. Choose OpenAI, Google Gemini, Claude, etc.
4. Paste your API key

### Enterprise Tier: API Key + Optional Hosted LLM

**Enterprises can:**
- ✅ Use BYOK (same as Pro/Teams)
- ✅ OR: Deploy their own LLM server (on-prem)
- ✅ OR: Use Top Dog's optional managed LLM service (additional cost)

**Enterprise LLM options:**

| Option | Cost | Privacy | Control |
|--------|------|---------|---------|
| **BYOK** | Your provider's cost | High | You |
| **Self-hosted** | Infrastructure cost | Very high | You |
| **Top Dog Managed LLM** | Custom pricing | High | Shared |

---

### API Key Security & Storage

#### Where Are Keys Stored?

**Free Tier:**
- No keys needed
- Nothing stored

**Pro/Teams/Enterprise:**
- Keys stored in user's local config: `~/.Top Dog/llm_keys.json`
- Keys encrypted at rest using system keyring
- Keys NEVER transmitted to Top Dog servers
- Keys NEVER logged or monitored by Top Dog
- Keys NEVER used for any purpose except calling the provider

#### Key Handling Policy

```
WHAT Top Dog DOES:
✅ Encrypt keys locally in system keyring
✅ Use keys ONLY to call provider APIs on YOUR behalf
✅ Keep keys for duration of user session
✅ Allow users to revoke keys anytime

WHAT Top Dog DOES NOT DO:
❌ Send keys to our servers
❌ Log or monitor your API usage
❌ Store keys in plain text
❌ Share keys with anyone
❌ Use keys for any purpose except your requests
❌ Charge you (you pay provider directly)
```

#### API Key Responsibility Agreement

By using Top Dog's Pro/Teams tier with your own API key:

1. **You own your API key** - It's your responsibility to keep it safe
2. **You manage your costs** - Your usage = your bill from the provider
3. **You revoke if needed** - Delete the key from Top Dog anytime
4. **You understand pricing** - Read the provider's pricing carefully
5. **Top Dog is not responsible for** - Unexpected charges, key theft, lost keys

### Honest FAQ About API Keys

**Q: "Will Top Dog ever provide API keys?"**  
A: No. We're a product company, not a payment processor. This keeps us focused on building great tools, not managing billing for 1000 LLM providers.

**Q: "What if I lose my API key?"**  
A: Delete it from Top Dog, generate a new one on the provider's dashboard. Takes 2 minutes.

**Q: "What if someone steals my API key?"**  
A: They have access to your usage until you revoke it. Revoke immediately on the provider's dashboard. This is why we recommend setting spending limits.

**Q: "Can I use free models AND paid models?"**  
A: Yes! You can assign different LLMs to different roles. Use Ollama for local work, GPT-4 for complex tasks.

**Q: "Does Top Dog see my API usage?"**  
A: No. We never see, monitor, or log your API calls. You see your usage on the provider's dashboard.

**Q: "Can I share an API key with my team?"**  
A: Not recommended (security risk), but technically yes. Better approach: each team member gets their own key, and you manage a shared budget on the provider's side.

**Q: "What if the LLM provider goes down?"**  
A: Top Dog continues working with local models. Cloud features are unavailable until the provider recovers.
