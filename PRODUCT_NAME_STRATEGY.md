# 🎯 Top Dog PRODUCT NAME STRATEGY

## Problem
Google Search confuses "Top Dog" with "Amazon Q Developer"
- Amazon Q Developer is AWS's AI coding assistant
- Your Top Dog is an independent AI IDE (competing product)
- Need to **disambiguate** while keeping "Top Dog" brand

---

## Solution: Name Variation Strategy

### Primary Brand
**Top Dog** - Used everywhere, but with disambiguating tagline

### Official Full Name
**Top Dog - TopDog AI Development Environment**

### Why This Works
- "Top Dog" = memorable, short, unique domain
- "TopDog" = differentiates from Amazon Q
- "AI Development Environment" = describes what it does
- Together: **clear, distinctive, defensible**

---

## Name Variations for Different Contexts

### Website Homepage
```
Top Dog | TopDog AI Development Environment
```

### Google Ads / SEO
```
Top Dog - AI Code Editor & Refactoring Platform
```

### Product Hunt / Social Media
```

```

### Technical Docs

```

```

### Comparison Pages

```

## Meta Tags Strategy

### Homepage Meta Tags

<meta name="description" content="Top Dog: The TopDog AI IDE. 53+ LLMs, unlimited refactoring, team collaboration. Code 10x faster than VS Code.">

```

```

## Search Strategy

### High-Priority Keywords
```
Primary (Unique):
- "Top Dog IDE"
- "Top Dog topdog"
- "Top Dog refactoring"

Secondary (Competitive):
- "AI IDE"
- "code refactoring platform"
- "AI pair programmer"

Long-tail:
- "best AI IDE for Python"

### What NOT to Compete On
