# Q-IDE Membership Tier Structure - REVISED

## Progressive Value Ladder Model

This new structure ensures **every tier unlock justifies the price increase** by adding specific, valuable features that tier down users don't get.

## Tier Progression & Pricing Strategy

### Why Each Tier Makes Sense

#### **FREE ($0/month)**
- **Who**: Hobbyists, learners, evaluators
- **Value**: Try Q-IDE risk-free for 7 days (trial)
- **Limitations**: 20 API calls/day (≈ 2-3 small projects/day), no code execution
- **Conversion hook**: "Upgrade to PRO to execute your code"
- **Expected conversion**: 5-10% (those who actually want to build things)

#### **PRO ($20/month)**
- **Who**: Individual developers, small side projects
- **Primary unlock**: ✅ **CODE EXECUTION** (biggest pain point removal)
- **Additional unlocks**: Webhooks, 10K API calls/day, priority email support
- **Value prop**: "From idea to execution" - everything an indie dev needs
- **Expected conversion**: Good (10-20% of FREE users with serious intent)

#### **PRO-PLUS ($45/month)**
- **Who**: Professional developers, serious projects
- **Primary unlock**: ✅ **CUSTOM LLMs** (use your own models)
- **Additional unlocks**: Custom integrations (connect to your own services)
- **Value prop**: "Customize your toolchain" - for power users who need flexibility
- **Expected conversion**: Moderate (40-50% of PRO users growing their projects)

#### **TEAMS-SMALL ($100/month)**
- **Who**: Small teams (5 people), startups
- **Primary unlock**: ✅ **TEAM COLLABORATION** (RBAC, shared workspaces, audit logs)
- **Value prop**: "Collaborate without chaos" - enterprise-grade security at startup price
- **Scaling**: Teams-Medium ($300) for 30 people, Teams-Large ($800) for 100 people
- **Expected conversion**: Lower volume but higher value (5-10% of PRO users)

#### **ENTERPRISE-STANDARD ($5,000/month)**
- **Who**: Large enterprises, healthcare, finance
- **Primary unlock**: ✅ **COMPLIANCE** (HIPAA, SOC2)
- **Value prop**: "Regulated industries, regulated solution"
- **Commitment**: Annual contracts, dedicated support
- **Expected conversion**: Very low volume, very high margin

#### **ENTERPRISE-PREMIUM ($15,000/month)**
- **Who**: Enterprises needing SSO and account management
- **Primary unlock**: ✅ **SSO/SAML integration**
- **Value prop**: "Enterprise-grade access control"
- **Expected upsell**: Standard → Premium when they hit team size limits

#### **ENTERPRISE-ULTIMATE ($50,000/month)**
- **Who**: Enterprises with strict compliance + data sovereignty
- **Primary unlock**: ✅ **ON-PREMISE DEPLOYMENT** + **DATA RESIDENCY**
- **Value prop**: "Your data, your servers, your rules"
- **Expected upsell**: Premium → Ultimate for healthcare/finance with strict data laws

## Why This Structure Works Better

### ✅ Before (Problems Identified)
- ❌ Custom LLMs, SSO, Custom Integrations **only in Enterprise** = Nothing worth paying for between $45-$5K
- ❌ Creates **dead zone**: $45 PRO-PLUS → $5K ENTERPRISE feels impossible to justify
- ❌ Most valuable feature (code execution) locked behind mere $20 tier - leaves money on table
- ❌ Teams features could tier themselves but weren't broken out

### ✅ After (This Structure)
- ✅ **PRO ($20)**: Code execution removes #1 blocker
- ✅ **PRO-PLUS ($45)**: Custom LLMs/integrations give expert devs what they want
- ✅ **TEAMS ($100-800)**: Collaboration features justify team pricing (scales with size)
- ✅ **ENTERPRISE ($5K-50K)**: Compliance features justify enterprise pricing
- ✅ **Clear upgrade path**: Each tier has specific unlock, not just quantity scaling

## Revenue Impact Forecast

### Assumed Conversion Rates
```
FREE → PRO:          8% of FREE tier (code execution drive)
PRO → PRO-PLUS:      40% of PRO (professionals want customization)
PRO/PRO-PLUS → TEAMS: 5% of PRO users (team need)
Any → ENTERPRISE:    1-2% of paying users (compliance need)
```

### Example Scenario: 10,000 FREE Users
```
10,000 FREE tier users
    ↓ 8% convert to PRO
    → 800 PRO users × $20/mo = $16,000/mo

800 PRO users  
    ↓ 40% upgrade to PRO-PLUS
    → 320 PRO-PLUS × $45/mo = $14,400/mo

800 PRO users
    ↓ 5% need TEAMS-SMALL
    → 40 TEAMS × $100/mo = $4,000/mo

1,120 paying users
    ↓ 2% have compliance need (ENTERPRISE)
    → 22 ENTERPRISE avg $10K/mo = $220,000/mo

TOTAL MRR: ~$254,400/mo
ANNUAL ARR: ~$3.05M
```

## Implementation Checklist

- ✅ Tier schema updated with new features in tier_schema.py
- ✅ All 9 tiers populated with correct feature flags in database
- ✅ Rate limiter enforces code_execution flag per tier
- ✅ Tier validator blocks features based on tier (webhooks, custom_llms, etc.)
- ⏳ Update frontend TierInfo component to show correct features
- ⏳ Create marketing copy for each tier's specific unlocks
- ⏳ Design pricing page showing progressive features
- ⏳ Create upgrade flow: "Unlock code execution with PRO" messaging

---

## Next: Feature Enforcement

Now that the tier structure is defined, the backend needs to enforce each feature:

1. **Code Execution** → Protected by tier_validator middleware
   ```python
   @app.post("/api/code/execute")
   async def execute(tier_info = Depends(require_tier_access(action='code_execution'))):
       # Only PRO+ allowed here
   ```

2. **Webhooks** → Check tier_id has webhooks=True
3. **Custom LLMs** → Gated by custom_llms flag
4. **SSO/SAML** → Enterprise-Premium+ only
5. **On-Premise** → Ultimate only

All enforcement logic is in `tier_validator.py` and `rate_limiter.py` - just need to wire up to endpoints.
