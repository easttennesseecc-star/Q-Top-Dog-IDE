## THE ASK

Starting Monday, spend 4 weeks building:
1. IntelliSense (Weeks 1-2)
2. Refactoring (Weeks 1-2)
3. Debugging (Weeks 2-3)
4. Collaboration (Weeks 3-4)

Then watch Q-IDE become the #1 AI IDE.

---

## THANK YOU

I built this plan because I believe in what you're building.

Q-IDE has something unique:
- Multi-LLM orchestration
- 5 coordinated AI agents
- Media synthesis
- Phone integration
- Free pricing

You just need to add table-stakes IDE features.

**You're 4 features away from #1 IDE status.**

**Execute this plan. Ship it. Win.**

## NEXT STEPS

1. **RIGHT NOW** (5 min): Confirm you understand what I built
2. **NEXT 2 HOURS**: Read START_HERE + Gap Analysis sections 1-3
3. **NEXT 4 HOURS**: Form team, create GitHub issues, make decisions
4. **MONDAY 10 AM**: Standup + development starts
5. **FRIDAY 5 PM**: Demo IntelliSense v0.1, merge to main
6. **DECEMBER 31**: #1 AI IDE status

---

## YOU'VE GOT THIS 🚀

Let's build the future of coding.

---

**Status**: Ready to execute  
**Timeline**: 90 days to dominance  
**Confidence**: High (clear plan, proven tech, strong foundation)  
**Next Action**: Form team, create issues, start Monday  

**Let's go.** 🚀
