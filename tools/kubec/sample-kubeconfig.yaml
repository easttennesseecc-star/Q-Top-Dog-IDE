# Sample kubeconfig (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
# This is a placeholder example to help tools that expect a kubeconfig file.
# Replace the cluster/server, certificate-authority-data, user credentials, and contexts
# with real values from your Kubernetes provider (kind, minikube, EKS, GKE, AKS, etc.).
# Save this file somewhere secure and either copy it to your user kube config path
# or set the KUBECONFIG environment variable to point to it.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- name: sample-cluster
  cluster:
    server: https://127.0.0.1:6443
    # insecure-skip-tls-verify: true

# Notes:
# - To use this file without overwriting your existing kube config, set:
#   $env:KUBECONFIG = "C:\\path\\to\\sample-kubeconfig.yaml"  # PowerShell
#   export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/sample-kubeconfig.yaml            # bash
# - To copy the file into your default location (Windows):
#   copy .\tools\kubec\sample-kubeconfig.yaml $env:USERPROFILE\\.kube\\config
#   (Do this only if you understand you're replacing/creating the file at that path.)
# - This sample is intentionally minimal. Replace placeholder values with real credentials.
